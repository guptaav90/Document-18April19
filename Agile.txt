1#What is Agile?
Agile is a process or methodology or dynamic env. where nothing is fixed,based on the requirement can be changed, so user has more readabilty in duration of devlepment
and testing before making a product,Where in agile all teams are works together parallelly dev. team develop the source code and testing team write the test cases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3#Difference between traditional model and agile testing?
1.In traditional model testing is done at the end of the development where as in agile testing is done parallel to development.
2.In traditional model testing is done on whole application where as in agile testing is done on small features.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3#Difference between iterative vs incremental development?
In iterative development we are developing the application continuously till end of the last requirment and release to the testing and client or customer and 
get the feedback from client to dev. team then they want some changes then dev. team need a time to implement those changes whereas in incremental development we are 
develop the application in small small parts and release to customer, so they can give feedback and implement those changes quickly, 
so here we are save the lot of time and acheving the accuracy of requirement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What qualities should a good agile tester have?
1.agile tester should be understand the requirement quickly 
2.agile tester should know agile concept and principle

2#What is burn up and burn down?
1.burn up represent the chart how much work has been completed in project by dev.team and testing team.
2.burn down represent the chart how much work are remaining in project by dev.team and testing team.

3#What is UserStroy and task and Epic?
UserStory is a part of reqiurment where all the requirments are mentioned in the form of acceptance criteria and many more like:
*SprintName
*Userstory of ownerName
*SprintTime
*SquadName
*Multiple task of DEV. and QA team
*Product OwnerName(CreatorName)
*CreationDate
*Comment Section
*BuildName
*Severity
*Priorty
*Env.Name
*StoryPoints
*History

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4#What is product backlog and sprint backlog
1.Product backlog - product backlog is mantained by product owner which contains multiple requirments and feature of the product in the form of priority wises.
2.Sprint backlog  - sprint backlog is subset of product backlog which contains user stories of the product which is related to the particular sprint.
(once all the requirments comes under the sprint backlog that will be convert in the form of user story)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5#Define the roles in scrum?
1.Product owner - Product owner is that person who convert the reqiurement into multiple user story and who has end to end knowledge of the requirement
 and works with customer or end users and scrum team and responsibilty of product backlog.

2.Scrum Master - Scrum Master is that person, who has reponsible for technical problems to resolved that and 
 make sure each sprint complete on time and ensure proper workflow to the team.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


6#What is sprint?
Sprint is specific time block where dev and testing team have to complete all the task within specific time which is created by both team in same user story 
and in same sprint. (generic sprint time is 2 weeks.)
